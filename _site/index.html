<p>Hello Again</p>
<p>So My layout is not working.
For some reason the base.njk file does not link
Also in my compiled html, the base template is not being propagated.
When I do pnpm run start it fails.
I can get it to run by removing the layout: base.njk line but what's the point if templates are not working?</p>
