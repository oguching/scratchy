# Scratchy

A simple Eleventy starter site that tracks the [eleventy base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) for simplicity and features.

Features
- simple
- clean
- minimal
- no tailwindcss
I have nothing against tailwind, just in the spirit of keeping things simple, it add an overhead we don't need.
- blog

I don't know any eleventy so I'm using this starter template to learn it.
